You can easily translate any language using Google translator, but creating your translator will be a satisfying experience as a programmer. 
The deep_translator is use to replace googletransAPI created by Google developers used to translate any text using Python. 
You can use this API for every task that you can do with the google translator. You can easily install this library in your systems by using the pip command; 
pip install deep-translator
To make a translator more interactive I will also create an interactive user interface by using the streamlit library in Python.
To run use python -m streamlit language_translator.py or streamlit run language_translator.py
